#summary

Lola is the foodie friend you wish you had in every city.
The app helps travelers answer the question 'Where do the locals eat?,' and lets
locals keep track of their favorite restaurants.


After signing up with their zipcode, new users are prompted to add at least
5 restaurants to the default 'Favorites' list before unlocking more site content.

From their profile page, users can edit existing lists and create new ones, using
search powered by the Yelp API.

Travelers can view a ranked list of top restaurants in a particular city based on
the knowledge and popular vote of locals, with locations plotted using the Google Maps
API.

Any list on the site can be shared via email using the SendGrid API -- this is
especially helpful for anyone who has a 'recommendations' email in their inbox
that they have to find and forward whenever someone is visiting and asks for tips!

All restaurants have a details page which includes a link to Yelp reviews, photos from
Instagram, and a link directly into the Instagram feed for that location.
